### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

	Lab 7, part 1 was my favorite because of how we calculated the date difference. I always wanted to understand how programs are made to calculate math problems and problem-solving programs. The use of functions was hard for me because it was my first time to use in this lab part, but as labs include more functions I understand them more and was able to use them without any setbacks. 

*Lab 3

	Lab 3, part 3 was my favorite as well because we created a guessing game program where we used different guessing plays to figure out if the program is working. It was interesting to me because it included different concepts that we have learned. Also, it makes me go back and think about different other concepts that we learned that I could have included which would have made it better and more efficient. 

*Lab 12

	Lab 12, part 1 was my favorite because we created an animated image with colors. It is interesting to me because I always wondered how C++ is used to make games and create a different gradient of colors. However, creating games is a very vast project and this lab is just a minor work in a project like that. One struggle I faced with this lab is how I had to apply a lot of different concepts in order to get the lab code to work.
